Sonic-R-Utilities
=================

Utilities for modifying or viewing the files of Sonic R.

Note that any Python programs are designed for Python 3. They should not require any external dependencies.

Files from the Sonic R disk may be required, however. (It's rather difficult to convert something you don't have, generally speaking.)
